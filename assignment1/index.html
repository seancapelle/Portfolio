		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="assets/images/sean.jpg">
		<p>I graduated from Towson University with a Bachelor's degree in Electronic Media and Film. From there, I moved to Florida and became a teacher. I taught middle school Language Arts, intensive reading, and creative writing. I then earned my Master's in Educational Leadership from the Univeristy of Central Florida.</p>
		<p>I then transitioned to a role outside of the classroom, called an Educational Technology Facilitator. My duties include resolving technical issues on campus, maintaining computer labs for student testing, and teaching coding and robotics.<p>
		<p>While I have played a strong role in education for over ten years, I am ready to take that next challenging step by becoming a full stack web developer. My blend of creativity and problem-solving skills would make me a valuable asset.</p>
